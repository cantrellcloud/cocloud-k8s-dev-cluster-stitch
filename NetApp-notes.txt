Yeah, you won't have that file currently, but you need it.   That's what the article is about. Tanzu makes it kind of a pain compared to other k8s distros where I'd just throw it out on the worker nodes. ðŸ™‚ So the article is about how to edit the idmapd.conf file and get it onto the worker nodes initially.  we just need whatever domain you use for the worker nodes to be set on the nfsv4iddomain on the netapp. I forgot to send you the instructions for that part

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/nfs-admin/specify-user-id-domain-nfsv4-task.html

https://kb.netapp.com/on-prem/ontap/da/NAS/NAS-KBs/What_is_an_NFS_-v4-domain-id

The good news is you can just make up a domain randomly, it doesn't have to exist in DNS or AD or anything.  The clients and workers just have to match.

What error did you get on the pod mounting the PVC? Just do a describe on the pod.
